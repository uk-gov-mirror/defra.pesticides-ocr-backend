## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v24` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v11`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd pesticides-ocr-backend
nvm use
```

## Local development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment variables

Create your local `.env` file from the example before running the app:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The file may be left empty, but it must exist: the development script runs
`node --watch --env-file-if-exists=.env`, and `--watch` fails to start with an
`ENOENT` error if the `.env` file is missing. `.env` is git-ignored, so any
values you add stay local.

### Git hooks

Install git hooks (optional)

```bash
npm run git:hooks
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing

To test the application run:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json).
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

### Formatting

#### Windows prettier issue

If you are having issues with formatting of line breaks on Windows update your global git config by running:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

## API endpoints

| Endpoint                                        | Method | Description                                          |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| `/health`                                       | GET    | Health check                                         |
| `/register`                                     | POST   | Submit a pesticide registration application          |
| `/whoami`                                       | GET    | Authenticated caller's identity (case-officer scope) |
| `/email-verifications`                          | POST   | Start email address verification (send OTP)          |
| `/email-verifications/{verificationId}/confirm` | POST   | Confirm a verification code                          |
| `/email-verifications/{verificationId}/resend`  | POST   | Resend a verification code                           |

### POST /register

Accepts a JSON body with a `formSession` object containing the registration form data.

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "formSession": {
    "businessActivities": ["manufacture", "market"],
    "businessName": "Company Name",
    "address": {
      "line1": "1 Example Street",
      "line2": "Village",
      "town": "Town",
      "county": "County",
      "postcode": "AB12 3CD"
    },
    "primaryContact": {
      "name": "Full Name",
      "telephone": "01234567890",
      "email": "contact@example.com"
    },
    "addressActivities": ["use", "store"],
    "quantity": {
      "quantityType": "area",
      "quantity": "50"
    },
    "professionalSectors": ["agriculture-horticulture"],
    "memberSchemes": ["BASIS"],
    "additionalAddresses": []
  }
}
```

**Response (201):**

```json
{ "reference": "PPP-ABC-123" }
```

Reference numbers use the format `{PREFIX}-XXX-XXX` (uppercase alphanumeric). The prefix defaults to `PPP` and is configurable via the `REFERENCE_PREFIX` environment variable.

### Email address verification (OTP)

Verifies ownership of an email address entered during the submission
journey, before the submission is completed. This is verification only —
it does not authenticate the user or create an account. Full design in
[docs/email-verification-design.md](./docs/email-verification-design.md).

```
POST /email-verifications                          { "email": "..." }        -> 201 { verificationId, expiresAt, ... }
POST /email-verifications/{verificationId}/confirm  { "code": "482913" }      -> 200 { verified, email }
POST /email-verifications/{verificationId}/resend   (no body)                 -> 201 { verificationId, expiresAt, ... }
```

Requires `EMAIL_OTP_HASH_SECRET` and `NOTIFY_TEMPLATE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_OTP`
to be set (see `.env.example`). Codes are never stored in plaintext or
logged; records auto-expire via a Mongo TTL index. This is a **frontend-only
gate** — `POST /register` is deliberately not checked against it; see the
design doc for the accepted trade-off that implies.

## API authorisation (EQ-413)

Protected routes require an `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` header carrying a Microsoft Entra token. The reusable pieces live in [`src/auth/`](./src/auth):

- an `entra-bearer` Hapi auth **strategy** — in `live` mode it verifies the JWT signature against the Entra tenant JWKS and checks issuer, audience and expiry; in `mock` mode it decodes the token without verification (local/CI only, refused in production);
- a `requireRole(...roles)` helper returning the route `auth` options that authorise the caller by Entra app-role (via Hapi scope).

Protect a route by opting in:

```js
import { requireRole } from '#/auth/require-role.js'

export const example = {
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/example',
  options: { auth: requireRole('case_officer') },
  handler: (request, h) => h.response(request.auth.credentials)
}
```

The role value(s) are configurable — `GET /whoami` reads `auth.entra.roleValues` (comma-separated) rather than hard-coding the string.

Routes without `options.auth` (e.g. `/health`) stay open. A request with no/invalid token gets `401`; a valid token lacking the required role gets `403`. Configure live mode via `AUTH_MODE=live` + the `ENTRA_*` variables (see `.env.example`). `GET /whoami` is a worked example.

> The exact token contract (whether the frontend forwards the Entra access token or ID token, i.e. the expected `audience`/`issuer`) is confirmed at Entra onboarding and is fully config-driven — no code change needed.

## Database seeding

Seed scripts are available for local development and testing.

### Seed records

Insert sample registration records (uses `SED-XXX-XXX` references to distinguish from real data):

```bash
npm run db:seed                 # insert 10 records (default)
npm run db:seed -- --count=50   # insert 50 records
```

### Delete seeded records

Remove all seeded records (those with a `SED-` reference prefix):

```bash
npm run db:seed:delete
```

Both scripts read `MONGO_URI` and `MONGO_DATABASE` from your `.env` file (or environment).

## Docker

Build:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --tag pesticides-ocr-backend .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -e PORT=3001 -p 3001:3001 pesticides-ocr-backend
```

### Docker Compose

A local environment with:

- Floci for AWS services (S3, SQS, SNS etc)
- Redis
- MongoDB
- This service.
- A commented out frontend example.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Mock AWS resources can be created when Floci starts up by editing the scripts in `./compose/floci/start.d/`.
MongoDB records can also be created when Mongo starts by editing the scripts in `./compose/mongo/`.
